This website provides various string manipulation tools to help you modify and analyze text. Here's a brief explanation of each tool:

String Length: This tool calculates and displays the number of characters in the entered text.

Count Words: This tool counts the number of words in the entered text. It considers a word as a sequence of characters separated by spaces, along with certain punctuation marks like '!', '.', and '?'.

Lowercase: This tool converts all uppercase letters in the entered text to lowercase, preserving the rest of the text as is.

Uppercase: This tool converts all lowercase letters in the entered text to uppercase, keeping the rest of the text unchanged.

Capitalize Word: This tool capitalizes the first letter of each word in the entered text. It treats spaces as word separators and ensures that the first letter of each word is capitalized.

Capitalize First Word: Similar to the previous tool, this one capitalizes the first letter of each sentence. It identifies sentence boundaries using punctuation marks ('.', '!', '?'), and then capitalizes the first letter after each of these marks.

You can use these tools to modify the case of your text, count words, capitalize words or sentences, and check the length of the text. Simply input your text in the provided text area, select the desired tool, and click the corresponding button. The result will be displayed below the buttons.
